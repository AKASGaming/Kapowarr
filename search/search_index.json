It tries to fetch for as many volumes as possible. If it can't fetch for them all in one go, the ones that didn't get fetched, get preference the next hour. For the fetched volumes, Kapowarr checks when the last time was that the metadata was updated and compares it to it's stored date. If it determines that the metadata for the volume has been updated since the last fetch, it applies the fetched metadata for the volume and fetches the metadata for all issues of the volume and apply that too.</p> <p>With this setup, all volumes (unless you have an absurdly big library) get updated every day and as little as possible requests are made. When we still surpass the limit, the volumes that need to fetched the most (the ones that haven't been updated for the longest) get preference to ensure that they \"keep up\". With this setup, worst case scenario, 25.000 volumes and 25.000 issues can be updated per hour. However, because metadata of a volume doesn't get updated often, Kapowarr only needs to update a few volumes per day, assuming you have a library of a few thousand volumes.</p>"},{"location":"rate_limiting/#mega","title":"Mega","text":"<p>If a Mega download reaches the rate limit of the account mid-download (no way to calculate this beforehand), the download is canceled and all other Mega downloads in the download queue are removed.

Alternative services like MediaFire and GetComics are used instead of Mega while we wait for the limit to go down again.

If multiple services are offered for the same download, Kapowarr will use this preference list to determine what service to pick (if the link of the top service doesn't work, Kapowarr falls back to the other options, in order).

The naming of the files follows the format set in the settings (see Settings -&gt; Media Management -&gt; File Naming).</p> Unzipping <p>Kapowarr has unzipping built-in. This means that it can extract zip files, filter the content to find the files that are actually desired, delete the other files, move the files to the correct location and name them correctly, delete the zip folder and delete the zip file. This can be done automatically for all downloaded zip files by enabling Settings -&gt; Media Management -&gt; Unzipping -&gt; Unzip downloads. Unzipping can also be done for all zip files of a volume by pressing the \"Unzip\" button when viewing a volume.</p> <p>Importing an already existing library into Kapowarr is currently not very fluid (the \"Library Import\" feature found in Radarr/Sonarr is not yet implemented in Kapowarr).
