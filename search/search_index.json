Kapowarr first analyses the page and collects all groups and their links (one group per download).</li> <li>Next, it will combine multiple groups to cover as many issues as possible (if the download is for more than one issue). This collection of groups will form a 'path'. Groups are only added to a path if Kapowarr thinks that the group is actually downloading something we want. There can be multiple paths, in the case where there are conflicting groups. For example when there is a torrent download for all issues and multiple other downloads for issues 1-10, 11-20, etc.</li> <li>All the links in the first path are tested, to see if they work, are supported and are allowed by the blocklist. A link could not be supported because the service is simply not supported, or because it's a torrent download and no torrent client is set up. If enough links pass, all the downloads in the path are added to the queue to be downloaded. If not enough links pass, the next path is tested until one is found that passes. If none pass, the page is added to the blocklist for having no working links.</li> <li>When a path passes and it's groups are added to the download queue, a decision needs to be made for which service is going to be used for each group (direct download, Mega, MediaFire, etc.).

The official Docker documentation hub offers great instructions on how to install docker CLI and Docker Desktop. Take notice of whether you installed the 'Docker CLI' (the Docker documentation also calls this 'Docker CE') or 'Docker Desktop', for future instructions.</p> Quick introduction to Docker <p>Docker allows you to create little virtual computers, called 'containers'. You can run an application inside these containers. This is useful because you decide how much resources these containers can use, and what access these applications get to \"the outside\". It makes it safer (e.g. the application only has access to folders on the computer that you explicitly give it access to), and makes installation easier (the developer makes sure that inside the container everything is setup properly, not you).</p> <p>Allowing folders and network connections through the container is done using 'mapping'. For example, you can map the folder <code>D:\\Comics</code> on the host to the folder <code>/comics</code> inside the container. Then everything inside the host folder (<code>D:\\Comics</code>) is visible to the application via the mapped container folder (<code>/comics</code>). Mapping network ports works in a similar manner.</p> <p>When you turn off a container, all file changes inside the container (e.g. folders/files added) are lost. This is so that the environment inside the container when starting up is always the same.

All content is put in these folders. Kapowarr needs at least one root folder set in order to work properly.</p> <p>When adding a volume (or when editing one), you choose in which root folder all content for that volume is put. Kapowarr will never touch any files outside the root folders (except in the download folder). You might have multiple root folders because you store your comics on multiple drives or want different access rights to certain volumes, to name a few reasons.</p> <p>Adding root folders on Docker</p> <p>If you use Docker to run Kapowarr, then the root folder that you enter in the web-UI is the mapped folder, not the folder path on the host machine. That means that if you followed the installation instructions, you would need to enter <code>/comics-1</code>, <code>/comics-2</code>, etc. as your root folder.</p>"},{"location":"settings/settings/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>You can find documentation for each setting here.
