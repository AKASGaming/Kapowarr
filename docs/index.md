# Kapowarr Docs

## Features

Kapowarr allows you to build a digital library of comics. You can add volumes, map them to a folder and start managing! Download issues of the volume (or TPB's), rename them and move them. The whole process is automated, and can be customised in the settings.

Each day, each volume is checked to see if a new issue has come out and if so, it will be immediately be downloaded and added to your library.
