# Kapowarr Documentation Hub

__Kapowarr is a software to build and manage a comic book library, fitting in the *arr suite of software.__

Kapowarr allows you to build a digital library of comics. You can add volumes, map them to a folder and start managing! Download, rename, move and convert issues of the volume (including TPB's, One Shots, Hard Covers, and more). The whole process is automated and can be customised in the settings.

## Finding Documentation

In the web-UI of Kapowarr, the documentation for that topic will be found at the same URL path.  
This means that for information about the 'File Naming' setting, (found at `{host}/settings/mediamanagement#file-naming`), the docs for that setting can be found at `https://casvt.github.io/Kapowarr/settings/mediamanagement#file-naming`.
